In the main function, create an instance of the Student class and initialize its data members. Then, open a file for writing and write the contents of the Student object to the file.


#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
class student
{
	public:
		string name;
		int age;
		double grade;
};
int main()
{
    student s;
    s.age=22;
    s.name="abc";
    s.grade=8.2;
    fstream f;
	f.open("details", ios::out);
	f<<"name: "<<s.name<<" age: "<<s.age<<" grade: "<<s.grade;
	f.close();
