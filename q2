#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
class student
{
	public:
		string name;
		int age;
		double grade;
};
int main()
{
    student s;
    s.age=22;
    s.name="abc";
    s.grade=8.2;
    fstream f;
    string str;
	f.open("details", ios::in);
	while(f>>str)
	{
		cout<<str<<" ";
	}
	f.close();
