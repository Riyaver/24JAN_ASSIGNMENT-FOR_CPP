4     Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Book objects and prints them to the console. The program should use the fstream library to open the file, read the Book objects one at a time, and print their title, author, ISBN, price and stock to the console.

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
class book
{
	public:
		string title,author,ISBN;
		double price;
		int stock;
};
main()
{
	book b;
	b.title="abc";
	b.author="xyz";
	b.ISBN="12a";
	b.price=234.12;
	b.stock=2;
	fstream f;
	string str;
	f.open("book", ios::binary | ios::in);
	while(f>>str)
	{
		cout<<str<<" ";
	}
	f.close();}
